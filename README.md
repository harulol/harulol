# Hello!

My name is **Hawu**. And now, I shall assault your eyes with emojis to catch your attention.

## General Stuff

My alias "Hawu" is just an unoriginal name from the other name that I also go by, "Haru".

I reside in a certain Asian country, please do not name or my stomach will be ripped. Timezone is +9 in case of contact.

Below is just a random block for no reason.

```c
// general.c

struct Person
{
    char *name;
    char *alias;
    int timezone;
};

struct Person *get_current()
{
    struct Person *person = (struct Person *)malloc(sizeof(struct Person));
    person->name = (char *)malloc(MAX);
    person->alias = (char *)malloc(MAX);

    strcpy(person->name, "Haru"); // My name is probably Haru, you don't know.
    strcpy(person->alias, "Hawu"); // An online alias, which is an unoriginal take on Haru.

    person->timezone = 9;
    return person;
}
```

## Languages

I mean, I learn new things every day. I can't claim I know by heart any languages. All languages kinda have the same concepts, just different ways of executing, syntaxes, etc.

Oh, and if you're asking about natural languages, I speak mostly **English**, kinda obvious though.

**Languages that I would be comfortable working with**:

</p>

**Languages that I have worked with quite a bit, but not quite THAT comfortable**:

<p float="left">

<img src="./assets/scala.png" width=30 alt="Scala" />
<img src="./assets/python.png" width=48 alt="Python" />
<img src="./assets/javascript.png" width=48 alt="JavaScript" />
<img src="./assets/typescript.png" width=48 alt="TypeScript" />

</p>

**Languages that I have learned and used quite rarely**:

<p float="left">

<img src="./assets/clojure.png" width=48 alt="Clojure" />
<img src="./assets/c.png" width=48 alt="C" />
<img src="./assets/cpp.png" width=48 alt="C++" />
<img src="./assets/go.png" width=128 alt="Go" />
<img src="./assets/groovy.png" width=100 alt="Groovy" />

</p>

**Languages that I have tried learning**:

<p float="left">

<img src="./assets/rust.png" width=48 alt="Rust" />
<img src="./assets/apl.png" width=48 alt="Dyalog APL" />
<img src="./assets/c-sharp.png" width=42 alt="C-Sharp" />

And below you see a random block of characters that you need not understand.

```kotlin
// comfortable-languages.kt

fun getComfortableLanguages() = listOf("Kotlin", "Java")
```

```scala
// known-languages.scala

def knownLanguages: List[String] = 
  List(
    "Scala", 
    "Python", 
    "JavaScript", 
    "TypeScript",
  )
```

```clojure
;; rarely-used-languages.clj

(defn get-rarely-used-languages []
  '("Clojure" "C" "C++" "Go" "Groovy"))
```

```rust
// tried-languages.rs

pub fn get_tried_languages() -> Vec<String> {
  vec!["Rust".to_string(), "Dyalog APL".to_string(), "C#".to_string()]
}
```
</details>

## Goals for now?

Probably just to learn **Rust** better, and maybe **Swift** in near future. My goal is just simply to be flexible and can utilize many tools to get the job done.

Learning new things is always fun, and I'm always open to.
